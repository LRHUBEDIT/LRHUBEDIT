- This Bot Is a Whitelist bot for a Roblox hub integration, everything will be explained on how to use it.You can modify the code if you know how, else i don't recommand trying to modify it.
How do i setup it ?
First, create a replit acc and create a python replit.
In main.py paste the code from the github main.py , you will have to replace your variables with roles names, file name
Create a json file , call it whatever you want , just indicate it in main.py file
Create a file named webserver.py and paste the code from github webserver.py
Then in your roblox hub , add this whitelist system ; This is an example i don't promise that this is secure and you can modify it if you know how to code :
